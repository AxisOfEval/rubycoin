# RubyCoin
RubyCoin *aims* to be the one library that rules them all crypto-currencies. Currently, only Bitcoin is supported. Adding support for other crypto-currencies is fairly simple and contributions and pull-requests are always welcome.

## Installation
Installing the gem is trivial. It has extremely few dependencies besides OpenSSL.

  $ gem install rubycoin

Or, if you are using bundler in your project, add the following line to your Gemfile and you're ready to roll.

  gem 'rubycoin'

## Contributing
Currently, the primary goal is to be able to generate addresses for as many as crypto-currencies as possible. The main candidates are:

  1. Litecoin
  2. Peercoin
  3. Dogecoin
  4. Mastercoin
  5. Namecoin
  6. Quark
  7. Feathercoin
  8. Primecoin
  9. Megacoin
  10. Infinitecoin
  11. Novacoin
  12. Worldcoin
  13. Darkcoin
  14. Vertcoin
  15. Maxcoin

Once the address generation mechanism and API is fairly stable for these currencies, signing messages and interacting will respective block-chains over the network *may* be considered.

Also, complete test coverage will be neat. It is currently absent.
